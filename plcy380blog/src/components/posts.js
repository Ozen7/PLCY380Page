        Reflection:
<br/>
<h3>1. What did you learn about your issue from this challenge?</h3>
        <p>
            From the challenge, I gained a deeper understanding of the risks posed by deepfake to personal and creative content. The documents I read mentioned that deepfakes not only have the potential to deceive audiences and influence public opinion but also present legal and ethical challenges around identity theft and intellectual property ownership. The increasing use of AI in generating fake media, music, and art raises new issues about consent and copyright, and has potential for great harm, both socially and politically.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What was successful or least successful? Why?</h3>
        <p>
            The successful part of this challenge was the wide variety of different sources that I was able to find. From governmental documents to op-eds to legal journals to youtube videos, I found a really nice wide variety of sources. Least successful was the lack of social groups already tackling this issue. That is, I wasn't able to find a huge organization that was pursuing justice or legal action about my issue
        </p>

        <h3>3. What might you do differently?</h3>
        <p>
            If I were to approach this challenge again, I would also focus on conducting analysis of different countries' legal approaches to deepfakes and AI content theft. Understanding how various jurisdictions are tackling these challenges could provide insights into best practices and potential frameworks that could be adopted in the United States.
        </p>

        <h3>4. How will this challenge help you moving forward?</h3>
        <p>
            This challenge has reinforced the importance of staying informed about the ethical and legal implications that AI brings along with its advancement. Moving forward, I will consider the broader consequences of AI advancements in any related projects or research I do. The knowledge gained will also be invaluable in discussions and advocacy for better regulations and protections for individuals and creators affected by AI technologies.
        </p>

        <h3>5. What questions do you have after completing this challenge?</h3>
        <p>
            After completing this challenge, several questions remain:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How can legislation keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI technology without stifling innovation?</li>
            <li>What role should tech companies play in preventing the misuse of AI for creating deepfakes and stealing content?</li>
            <li>How can we effectively educate the public to recognize and respond to deepfakes and AI-generated content?</li>
            <li>Are there technological solutions, such as watermarking or AI-based detection systems, that can help user distignuish real from AI-generated?</li>
        </ul>
